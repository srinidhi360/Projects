### This is a dataset picked from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset

#### Context
- This dataset contains tree observations from four areas of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. All observations are cartographic variables (no remote sensing) from 30 meter x 30 meter sections of forest. There are over half a million measurements total!

#### Content
- This dataset includes information on tree type, shadow coverage, distance to nearby landmarks (roads etcetera), soil type, and local topography.

what types of trees grow in an area based on the surrounding characteristics?
 
  * What kinds of trees are most common in the Roosevelt National Forest?
  * Which tree types can grow in more diverse environments? 
  * Are there certain tree types that are sensitive to an environmental factor, such as elevation or soil type?

The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. You are asked to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:

1 - Spruce/Fir

2 - Lodgepole Pine

3 - Ponderosa Pine

4 - Cottonwood/Willow

5 - Aspen

6 - Douglas-fir

7 - Krummholz


The training set (15120 observations) contains both features and the Cover_Type. The test set contains only the features. You must predict the Cover_Type for every row in the test set (565892 observations).
